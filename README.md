# Client-Server-Development

  How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
  When it comes to writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I always try to keep things simple and organized. I like to break my code down into smaller, reusable pieces, which makes it easier to read and update later. For example, in Project One, I created a CRUD Python module to connect to a MongoDB database, and I used that same module in Project Two to power the dashboard widgets. It made the whole process smoother because everything was already set up, and I could just focus on the dashboard. Plus, having that reusable module means I can use it again in future projects with a few tweaks, which is a huge time-saver.

  How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
  When I’m faced with a new problem, especially in a project like this, I start by really understanding what’s needed and then figuring out the best way to meet those requirements. For Grazioso Salvare, I made sure the database was designed to handle the right kind of data and that the dashboard was easy to use. This project was a bit different from others I’ve done because it combined a lot of different skills—database work, coding, and designing a user-friendly interface. Going forward, I’ll definitely keep using techniques like planning out the database structure and sketching out how the interface should look, so I can meet whatever requests a client might have.

  What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
  As a computer scientist, my job is to solve problems by creating systems that make things easier or more efficient. For a company like Grazioso Salvare, the dashboard I built would help them manage their data more easily and make better decisions, which ultimately helps them rescue animals faster. This kind of work shows how computer science can really make a difference, helping companies streamline their operations and work more effectively.
